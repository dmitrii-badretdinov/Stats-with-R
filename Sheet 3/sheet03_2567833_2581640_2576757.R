### Exercise 1: Plotting graphs using ggplot.
###############
# There are many ways of making graphs in R, and each has their own advantages 
# and disadvantages. One popular package for making plots is ggplot2. 
# The graphs produced with ggplot2 look professional and the code is quite easy 
# to manipulate.
# In this exercise, we'll plot a few graphs with ggplot2 to show its functionalities.
# You'll find all the information you'll need about plotting with ggplot2 here: 
# http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/


# Also, you have been assigned the ggplot2 course in DataCamp. Please work through 
# this course first to easily solve the assignment below

## a) First install and load the ggplot2 package. Look at the help for ggplot.

if(!require(ggplot2))
{
  install.packages(ggplot2)
  library(ggplot2)
}
?ggplot

## b) We're going to be plotting data from the dataframe 'ratings' 
##    (included in languageR). 
##    Look at the description of the dataset and the summary.

if(!require(languageR))
{
  install.packages(languageR)
  library(languageR)
}
?ratings
summary(ratings)

## For each word, we have three ratings (averaged over subjects), one for the 
## weight of the word's referent, one for its size, and one for the words' 
## subjective familiarity. Class is a factor specifying whether the word's 
## referent is an animal or a plant. 
## Furthermore, we have variables specifying various linguistic properties, 
## such as word's frequency, its length in letters, the number of synsets 
## (synonym sets) in which it is listed in WordNet [Miller, 1990], its 
## morphological family size (the number of complex words in which 
## the word occurs as a constituent), and its derivational entropy (an 
## information theoretic variant of the family size measure). 
## Don't worry, you don't have to know what all this means yet in order to 
## be able to plot it in this exercise!

## c) Let's look at the relationship between the class of words and the length. 
##    In order to plot this, we need a dataframe with the means.
##    Below you'll find the code to create a new dataframe based on the existing 
##    dataset ratings.
##    Plot a barplot of ratings.2 using ggplot. Map the two classes to two 
##    different colours. 
##    Remove the legend.
summary(ratings)
condition <- c("animal", "plant")
frequency <- c(mean(subset(ratings, Class == "animal")$Frequency), mean(subset(ratings, Class == "plant")$Frequency))
length <- c(mean(subset(ratings, Class == "animal")$Length), mean(subset(ratings, Class == "plant")$Length))
ratings.2 <- data.frame(condition, frequency, length)
ratings.2
ggplot(ratings.2,aes(y=length,x=frequency,color=condition))+geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="white")

## d) Let's assume that we have additional data on the ratings of words. 
##    This data divides the conditions up into exotic and common animals 
##    and plants.
##    Below you'll find the code to update the dataframe with this additional data.
##    Draw a line graph with multiple lines to show the relationship between 
##    the frequency of the animals and plants and their occurrence.
##    Map occurrence to different point shapes and increase the size 
##    of these point shapes.
condition <- c("animal", "plant")
frequency <- c(7.4328978, 3.5864538)
length <- c(5.15678625, 7.81536584)
ratings.add <- data.frame(condition, frequency, length)
ratings.3 <- rbind(ratings.2, ratings.add)
occurrence <- c("common", "common", "exotic", "exotic")
ratings.3 <- cbind(ratings.3, occurrence)
ratings.3
ggplot(ratings.3,aes(x=factor(occurrence),y=frequency,color=condition,group=condition))+geom_line()

## e) Based on the graph you produced in question d, 
##    what can you conclude about how frequently 
##    people talk about plants versus animals, 
##    with regards to how common they are?
##if they are common as well as plants it will decrease by occurence from common to exotic, 
#but if they are common as well as animal, the frequency will increase by occurence.

##Exercise 2. Binomial distribution
##########
## Suppose there are 12 multiple choice questions in a quiz. 
## Each question has 4 possible answers, and only one of them is correct. 

## a) Please calculate the probability of getting exactly 5 answers right 
##    if you answer by chance. Calculate this using the dbinom() function.
dbinom(5, size=12, prob=0.25)

## b) Next please calculate the probability of answering 4 or less questions 
##    correctly by chance. 
sum(dbinom(x=1:4, size=12, prob=0.25))



##########
##Exercise 3. Chi-square test
##########
## a) Consider the dataset dutchSpeakersDistMeta from sheet1. 
##    Load the package (languageR) and look at the summary of the variables, 
##    as well as their classes. Which variables are factors?

require(languageR)
data.frame(dutchSpeakersDistMeta)
str(dutchSpeakersDistMeta)

# Factors: Speaker, Sex, AgeGroup, ConversationType, EduLevel.

## b) We want to find out whether there is a difference between males and females 
##    with respect to the age groups they are in.
##	  First use the function 'table()' to get the counts and create 
##    a contingency table of AgeGroup by Sex.

contigency_table <- table(dutchSpeakersDistMeta$AgeGroup, dutchSpeakersDistMeta$Sex)

##    Visualize your data with a single bar plot (use ggplot) that represents the counts with 
##    respect to each age group and each sex.

require(ggplot2)
ggplot(dutchSpeakersDistMeta, aes(x = AgeGroup, fill = Sex)) + geom_bar()

## c) Inspect the table you created in b). Does it look like there could be a significant 
##    difference between the sexes?

# Yes, it looks like there could be a significant difference between the sexes.
# For example, it's visually visible that in the ages 18-24, 45-55, and 55+
# the percentage of females is noticeably more than a half.

## d) We are going to calculate whether there's a difference between males and females 
##    regarding their age group using the function chisq.test. 
##    Look at the help of this function. 
##    Then use the  function to calculate whether there's a difference in our table from b). 
##    Is there a significant difference in age group?

?chisq.test
chisq.test(contigency_table)

# The resulting p-value is more than 0.05. It means that there is indeed a
# significant difference in age group.

## e) What are the degrees of freedom for our data? How are they derived?

# Usually the degrees of freedom are calculated by (nrow - 1) * (ncol - 1),
# or, as said in the lecture, number of the categories minus one. 
# df = (2-1) * (5-1) = 4

##Exercise 4. Binomial versus chi-square
########## 
##    In this exercise, we will consider a made up example of there doctors can predict  
##    if a patient has temperature or not just by holding their hand  
##    Several doctors were blindfolded and were asked to tell if the experimenter  
##    has temperature/fever or not.  
##    There were a total of 200  trials, of which the doctors 
##    correctly indicated that a patient had fever 83 times.

## a) What is the null hypothesis, i.e. how often would we expect the doctor to 
##    be correct by chance (in raw number and in percentage)?
#Null hypothesis: Doctors cannot predict if the patient has fever by just holding their hand
#At chance level, p = 1/2 = 0.5, as there are 2 possible outcomes: having fever or not

## b) Using a chisquare test, what do you conclude about whether this idea
##    of checking fever/temperature works?
# p value here is given by 83(correctly predicted) / 200(number of trials)
# The chisq value is calculated as: E = 0.5*200 = 100
# O = 83
# chisq = (83-100)^2 / 100 + (117-100)^2 / 100 = 5.78
pchisq(5.78, df = 1, lower.tail=FALSE)
pchisq(5.78, df = 1)
# The p-values is 0.01620954, which is lower than 0.05
# it statistically significant and hence rejects null hypothesis
# This shows that checking temperature physically to test for fever is not by chance

## c) Now calculate significance using the binomial test as we used it in exercise 2.
pbinom(83, 200, 0.5, lower.tail=FALSE)
pbinom(100, 200, 0.5, lower.tail=FALSE)
# The value is 0.9903015, showing that the null hypothesis is true 
# and hence the prediction could actually be by chance

## d) The results from these two tests are slightly different. Which test do you think 
##    is better for our data, and why?
# Binomial test seems to be better for the given data as we are comparing to a fixed probability
# The chisquare test is an approximation and the data does not clearly mention how many are wrongly predicted 
# The observations might not be independent of one another as multiple tests could be from one doctor

##Exercise 5.
##########
## Describe a situation where you would choose McNemar's test over the ChiSquare test. 
## What would be the problem of using the normal ChiSquare test in a case where 
## McNemar's test would be more appropriate?

# According to the Lecture 4, ChiSquare test has two main limitations of its usage:
# 1. The resulting percentages should not be too small; 
# 2. The observations should be independent;
#
# The McNemar's test was given as the solution to the second case, that is when
# the observations are not independent.
# Several examples were given to show how the variables can be dependent on
# each other.
#
# It also is worthy of note that McNemar's test can be used only for two 
# variables.
#
# For example, McNemar's test would be more suitable than the ChiSquare test
# in the situation where the researches study the sleep schedule of the volunteers
# before and after they were informed why the inconsistent schedule is bad.
#
# The problem of using ChiSquare in this case would be that one of the assumptions
# (independent variables) is not followed, so the ChiSquare test would give
# the values that would be farther from truth than McNemar's test.
